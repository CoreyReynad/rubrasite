# AGENTS.md

## Goal
This repo is a static site (HTML/CSS/JS) deployed via GitHub Pages.
Prefer minimal dependencies and simple, readable code.

## Project structure
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js

## Rules
- Keep everything working on GitHub Pages (no build step).
- No external JS dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Keep CSS and JS in their files (no huge inline blocks).
- Respect existing design style unless task says "redesign".

## How to verify
- Site should load by opening index.html in a browser.
- Button on the page should still work.
